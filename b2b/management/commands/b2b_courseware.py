Courseware objects can be course runs, courses, or programs. specified by their readable ID (i.e. course-v1:MITxT+12.345s+3T2022). Contract should be specified by either their numeric ID or their slug.

Specifying courseware: You must specify one courseware item (of any type). You can specify more than one by adding "--also <courseware id>" to the end of the command. You can repeat this as many times as necessary.

To add courseware:
   b2b_courseware add [--no-create-runs] [--force] contract courseware [--also courseware] [--also courseware...]

Example: b2b_courseware add contract-100-101 program-v1:UAI+Fundamentals --also course-v1:UAI_C100+14.314x+2025_C101

Specifying a course run will attach it to the contract unless the contract is already attached to a contract. Specify "--force" to override any existing contract attachment.

Specifying a course will attempt to create a course run for the contract for the specified course. It will try to create a course run in edX as well unless "--no-create-runs" is specified.

Specifying a program will iterate through the program's courses and create runs for each. It will also link the program to the contract.

To remove:
    b2b_courseware remove [--remove-program-runs] contract courseware [--also courseware] [--also courseware...]

Example: b2b_courseware remove --remove-program-runs contract-100-101 program-v1:UAI+Fundamentals --also course-v1:UAI_C100+14.314x+2025_C101

Specifying a course run will unlink the run from the contract.

Specifying a course will unlink any of the course's runs that are attached to the contract from the contract.

Specifying a program will only unlink the program from the contract, unless "--remove-program-runs" is set. If it is, then all the runs that belong to both the contract and the program's courses will be removed from the contract. Note that doing this and then re-adding the program will *not* re-attach the existing runs to the contract - you will need to do that manually.
