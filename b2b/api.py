    Create a run for the specified contract.

    This does 3 main things:
    - Grab and identify the source course run, and create a new course key for
      the contract course run.
    - Create the contract course run in MITx Online, and queue a clone of the
      source course run in edX.
    - Create a product for the run.

    Source course runs are identified by looking for the most recent course run
    for the given course. This code expects you to pass in an MITx Online course
    that has a readable ID like 'course-v1:UAI_SOURCE+number` and that it has a
    run of some sort. This should just be a single run. If there's multiple runs,
    this code will grab the last one in the database.

    The MITx Online course run will belong to the source course. They will get a
    course key that is modified to represent the organization they belong to,
    the current year, and the contract ID. This means that the source course will
    have runs that have readable IDs that do not match the course ID.

    The course key is changed according to a set algorithm. For more information,
    see this discussion post: https://github.com/mitodl/hq/discussions/7525
    In general, this expects a course run that is in org `UAI_SOURCE` and then
    will create a new run that is `UAI_orgkey`, with a run tag that reflects
    the year we're creating the run in and the contract ID (`2025_C19` for
    instance).

    A product will be created for the new contract course run, and its price will
    either be zero or the amount specified by the contract. (Free courses still
    require either an association with the contract or an enrollment code for
    access.)

    Args:
        contract (ContractPage): The contract to create the run for.
        course (Course): The course for which we should create a run.
    Returns:
        CourseRun: The created CourseRun object.

    """
    Ensure that enrollment codes exist for the given contract.

    If the contract is non-SSO or if it specifies a price, we need to create
    enrollment codes so the learners can enroll in the attached resources.

    Enrollment codes are discounts. When the contract is seat-limited, we create
    one discount code per learner per product. When the contract is unlimited,
    we create one discount code per product, and set it to unlimited redemptions.

    When the contract is created or modified, we'll need to shore up the discount
    codes appropriately:
    - If there's no discounts for any of the products, create them.
    - If there are discounts, make sure they apply to all the products that
      we've created, and create new ones if necessary.
    - If there are too many discounts, log a warning message.
    - If the contract is SSO and unlimited, but there are discounts for the
      products, clear those products out. (Also remove the discounts if there
      was only one product in the discount.)

    Note about SSO contracts: if there's no price, we don't create enrollment
    codes regardless of whether there's a learner cap or not. We'll limit the
    attachment when we log the user in.

    Create a B2B enrollment for the given product for the current user.

    If the contract doesn't specify a price and the user is associated with the
    contract, we should create an order and an enrollment for the user. Otherwise,
    we should redirect the user to the basket add API, so they can use an
    enrollment code that they already have.

    If the result is unsuccessful for a B2B-related reason, the "result" key in
    the dict will contain one of the USER_MSG_TYPE_B2B_ERROR constants. If the
    result instead would require payment, the "result" key will contain some
    additional information.
    - The basket price. The code will total the basket; if it's not zero, it will
      skip trying to check out and will instead return an error.
    - The result from generate_checkout_payload. This may contain a further error
      (if, say, the user fails the blocked country check, or they're in the course
      already). If the order instead just requires checkout, this will include the
      redirect for that - the frontend should send the user to the cart page in this
      case, though, so the user can see what's going on before they proceed.

    Args:
    - request: The HTTP request object containing the user and basket data.
    - product: The Product object representing the B2B product to enroll in.
    Returns: a dict containing
    - "result": the result of the attempt; one of the USER_MSG_TYPE_B2B constants.
    - "order": the order ID if the enrollment was successful and no checkout is needed.
    - "price": the total for the basket, if enrollment did not succeed
    - "checkout_result": the result of the checkout attempt, if applicable.
