B2B Documentation
=================

The B2B system allows us to sell access to course and programs to organizations. It's also the foundation of the Universal AI program.

The B2B system originated in xPRO, which was focused on providing professional development and training content to businesses. Businesses would sign contracts with us to provide the content, and we would provide access in the form of enrollment codes to course offerings that were distributed to employees for their use. In MITx Online, this has been refined to work with SSO, so we can automatically grant access to eligible people based on their credentials.

Universal AI is essentially just another set of organizations and contracts within the system - the only real differentiator is what we call it, and that the organizations tend to be educational institutions.
