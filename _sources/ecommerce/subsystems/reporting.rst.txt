Reporting Subsystem
===================

OL marketing and finance team need to include financial data in their reporting, so they can evaluate and plan campaigns, reconcile accounts, and payout royalties. As a guiding principle, we want to be able to report on any data that is collected by the ecommerce system, but avoid supplementing the data with external considerations (such as marketing costs, or payout rates).

Use Cases
*********

MicroMasters
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of MicroMasters programs and courses function the same as any other MITx course, they wouldn’t otherwise be treated any differently except for marketing purposes, which are out of scope for this document if not MITx Online altogether.

DEDP
^^^^

The DEDP program as it is implemented currently is a special case when it comes to ecommerce - DEDP currently supports financial aid. This essentially amounts to a discount to a lower fixed rate. There are a few tiers of financial aid discounts available, but this is easily handled with a couple of preconfigured discounts. We’d need a UI somewhere that enables staff to assign a discount to a particular learner. That discount would then automatically apply to courses within that program, the same as any other program-scoped discount.
