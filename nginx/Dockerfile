#       functionality that compiles config/nginx.conf.erb

# Logs are configured to a relatic path under /etc/nginx
# but the container expects /var/log
RUN mkdir -p /etc/nginx/logs && ln -sf /var/log/nginx /etc/nginx/logs/

# erb unfortunately needs a whole ruby install
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby

# NOTE: this removes the args "-g daemon off" because nginx is impolite
#       and treats a cli flag and a config flag as duplicate:
#
#       nginx: [emerg] "daemon" directive is duplicate in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:3
#
