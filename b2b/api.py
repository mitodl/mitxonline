    """
    Create a contract run for the given course, importing it from edX if necessary.

    Wraps the create_contract_run function in some logic to check for the specified
    course, and then import it. If the course is imported from edX, this will set
    a few flags to reasonable values and call the import_courserun_from_edx
    function, then call create_contract_run using the imported run as the source
    course. If the course is already in the system, this just calls
    create_contract_run with the source run and the use_specific_course flag set
    to force it to use the specified run.

    The kwargs combine the set from import_courserun_from_edx and
    create_contract_run. Some of the defaults are different, owning to the use case
    for this function. Those differences are:
    - You must pass in a list of departments.
    - By default, the live flag is set to True.
    - Learn AI ingestion will be set to True.
    - require_designated_source_run is set to False. (We assume you want the
      specified course, regardless of the source flag.)

    In addition, if the course is imported, the corresponding run that is created
    for it will have the is_source_run flag set to True. This cannot be
    overridden. By using this function, we are assuming you really want the
    specified run as the source.

    This won't pass a price to the import call, so the imported run won't have a
    product. This _will_ set a price on the contract run, because the contract
    run must have a price, even if that price is zero. The price will be whatever
    is specified in the contract (or zero).

    Calling this function will result in a contract course run being created. If
    the course is imported, then you will end up with a course with two runs:
    the one that was imported and the new contract run.

    Args:
        contract (ContractPage): The contract to create the run for.
        course_run_id (str): The readable ID for the source course run.
        departments (list[Department | str]): Departments to add to the new course.
    Keyword Args (passed to import_courserun_from_edx and create_contract_run):
        live (bool): Make the new course run live, and the course if one is created.
        use_specific_course (str|None): Readable ID of a specific course to use as the base course.
        create_depts (bool): Create departments.
        block_countries (list[str] | None): Country codes to add to the block list for the course.
        create_cms_page (bool): Create a CMS page for the course. Only applies if a course is being created.
        publish_cms_page (bool): Publish the new CMS page. Only takes effect if creating a CMS page.
        include_in_learn_catalog (bool): Set the "include_in_learn_catalog" flag on the new page.
        ingest_content_files_for_ai (bool): Set the "ingest_content_files_for_ai" flag on the new page.
        skip_edx (bool): Don't try to create a course run in edX.
        require_designated_source_run (bool): Require a flagged source run.
    Returns:
        CourseRun: The created CourseRun object.

    Create a run for the specified contract.

    This does 3 main things:
    - Grab and identify the source course run, and create a new course key for
      the contract course run.
    - Create the contract course run in MITx Online, and queue a clone of the
      source course run in edX.
    - Create a product for the run.

    Source course runs are runs that have the "is_source_run" flag set. If one
    cannot be found, this will also check for a run with the run tag "SOURCE".
    If neither of those are found, it will throw an error. However, setting
    "require_designated_source_run" to False will add a third attempt, which will
    try to use whatever the first course run is for the specified course. This
    may not be what you want, so this functionality is disabled by default.

    The MITx Online course run will belong to the source course. They will get a
    course key that is modified to represent the organization they belong to,
    the current year, and the contract ID. This means that the source course will
    have runs that have readable IDs that do not match the course ID.

    The course key is generated according to a set algorithm. The new course key
    will have the organization part set to "UAI_orgkey" and the run tag set to
    "year_Cid" where orgkey is the organization key (set in the organization
    record), year is the current year, and id is the ID of the contract. For more
    information on the key format, see this discussion post:
    https://github.com/mitodl/hq/discussions/7525

    A product will be created for the new contract course run, and its price will
    either be zero or the amount specified by the contract. (Free courses still
    require either an association with the contract or an enrollment code for
    access.)

    Ensure that enrollment codes exist for the given contract.

    If the contract is non-SSO or if it specifies a price, we need to create

    Enrollment codes are discounts. When the contract is seat-limited, we create
    one discount code per learner per product. When the contract is unlimited,
    we create one discount code per product, and set it to unlimited redemptions.

    When the contract is created or modified, we'll need to shore up the discount
    codes appropriately:
    - If there's no discounts for any of the products, create them.
    - If there are discounts, make sure they apply to all the products that
      we've created, and create new ones if necessary.
    - If there are too many discounts, log a warning message.
    - If the contract is SSO and unlimited, but there are discounts for the
      products, clear those products out. (Also remove the discounts if there
      was only one product in the discount.)

    When we get a list of organizations from a source (so, in the user payload

    addition, once we've done that, we need to ensure they're also in the

    that isn't in the list we've received, we need to remove them; in addition,
    they should be removed from any "managed" contracts for the org they're in
    as well.

    There is a special case where the user may be in an organization that isn't
    represented in the payload we're given. This happens when the user uses an
    enrollment code. We update the org membership here and in Keycloak, but the

    indicates that we should leave those memberships alone - otherwise, we'll
    inadvertently add them to the org and then immediately remove them. (Once
    the org _does_ show up in the list, we should clear the flag.)
